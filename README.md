From 2008 to October 2023, this used to host the ASN1SCC compiler; an ASN.1 compiler
specifically made to target embedded systems.

Since I left the Agency more than a year ago, I handed over the repository to Maxime
Perrotin (maxime-esa) - please navigate [to the new repository here](https://github.com/maxime-esa/asn1scc).
